Hello!

Thank you for checking my project!

This is a reproduction of the famous "Snake Game", popularized in the 00s by the Nokia cell phones.

I found this ideia on a Codepen, published by the user "Fako29" (check it out here: https://codepen.io/Fako29/pen/dyppXZG). So I used it as a foundation for my final result.

Some modifications I inserted to the original idea are:

- A different layout, using HTML and CSS for it, and also making the game responsive for every screen and user-friendly;
- Enhancing the possibility of using the keyboard to play the game, inserting error treatment in the function responsible for it (the player can use the onscreen buttons, still);
- Decreasing the time the "snake" moves on screen, to make the game more dynamic.

Below you can see how the layout looks now in two scenarios:

1. During the game;
2. If the player fails and hits an obstacle.




To start the project, do the following:

1. Clone this repo to your machine;
2. Navigate to the 'SnakeGame' folder;
3. Open a terminal and type 'start snake.html';
4. You're good to go!

Once again, thank you for checking my project! Hope you enjoy it!
